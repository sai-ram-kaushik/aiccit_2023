                The main objective of <b>AICCIT-2023</b> is to invite all the
                Academicians, Researchers, and industrialists worldwide to
                participate and discuss the latest achievements in the advanced
                field of computing like Advancement in the Artificial
                Intelligence, Blockchain, Cyber Security, Distributed Computing
                and Internet of Things. The main goal of the conference is to
                provide a forum for high-quality reports on the state-of-the-art
                Theory, Technology, and Applications of advanced fields of
                computing as used in measurement, automation, and scientific
                research, in industry and business. The initiative provides a
                focused and highly interactive forum where both researchers and
                technologists have the opportunity to present and discuss
                leading research topics, developments, and future directions in
                their areas of interest. The importance of the conference is its
                vision to establish scientific contacts between research teams
                and scientists from different countries for future joint
                research collaborations.
